# Flappy-Bird

It's the old school web based program; the __Flappy Bird__. User just have to click the mouse button in order to make the _bird_ pass in between the _pipes_ and hence score points. __+1__ point is given upon successfully passing in between the _tunnel_ and the game ends when the _bird_ gets crashed into the _pipe_. The tech stacks used for this project is: 
```
  - JavaScript ES6
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
```
